// CHECKPOINT 8
// Your challenge is this: make a protocol that describes a building, adding various properties and methods, then create two structs, House and Office, that conform to it. Your protocol should require the following:

// 1. A property storing how many rooms it has. (Int)
// 2. A property storing the cost as an integer (e.g. 500,000 for a building costing $500,000.) (Int)
// 3. A property storing the name of the estate agent responsible for selling the building. (String)
// 4.  A method for printing the sales summary of the building, describing what it is along with its other properties.
//  5. Create two structs, House and Office that Conform to it.


//Here we go! Really psyched for this one :D

//Easy peasy - I love Protocols & Protocol Extensions. This is so intuitive.
